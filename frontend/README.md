# Chess Engine Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Chess Engine project, built with React and TypeScript.

## Features

- Interactive chessboard with drag-and-drop functionality
- Real-time move validation
- Move history tracking
- AI analysis integration
- Responsive design

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
